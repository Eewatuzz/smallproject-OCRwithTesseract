# Project Tesseract

Welcome to my small yet powerful project, crafted during my free time! 🚀

## What's Inside?
This project includes two amazing programs:
1. **PDF to Image** 📄➡️🖼️
2. **Image to Text** 🖼️➡️🔤

## Getting Started
Before diving in, make sure to install all the necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. But wait, there's one more thing! You need to install **Tesseract-OCR** first. 

### Installation Guide
For Windows users, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). Once installed, don't forget to add the directory where the Tesseract-OCR binaries are located (probably `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`) to your Path variables.

### How to Run

#### Image to Text
Convert an image to text with a single command:
```bash
python image_to_text.py your_image.png
```

#### PDF to Image
Transform a PDF into images effortlessly:
```bash
python pdf_to_image.py your_document.pdf
```

And voilà! Your files are processed in no time. 🚀
Happy coding! 🎉
